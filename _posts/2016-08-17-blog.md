**I**n the early 2000's the knitting world was turned on its head by a handful of badass knitters whose aim it was to shake up our antiquated view of what knitting had to be - to inspire knitters to get out of their boxes, to get creative, to put a skull & crossbones where a snowflake might once have gone, to use fuzzy eyelash yarn or metallic tape yarn in place of Shetland Wool, to be sexy, to stitch and, of course, to bitch.

The knitting world is changing once again. It's growing not only in popularity as men & women of all ages discover the creative, meditative, and badass benefits of knitting & purling, but it's growing in scale, too. As knitting needles get bigger & bigger, so too must yarn. While almost any yarn, string, or rope may be used in GIANT knitting, the most popular yarn of the moment hasn't even been made into yarn yet! The fiber is called wool roving. It's a raw, unspun wool that looks a bit like cotton candy before it's spun into more traditional yarn typically found in stores. This soft & fluffy fiber is likely what you've been seeing all over your Pinterest feed in the form of big-knit cozy scarves and GIANT luxurious blankets whose stitches may have you feeling like a tiny Alice in a GIANT Wonderland.

Like any fiber, wool roving has its pluses & minuses. Here's a brief rundown:

**PROS**

**CONS**

* luxurious
* big enough to create a solid fabric even with GIANT knitting needles
* available in endless colors from neutrals to vibrant shades
* can be so very soft & fluffy (note: 23 micron wool is lovely and 19 micron wool is even lovelier)
* creates impressive stitches and inviting finished products
* makes quick work of what is typically a very time-consuming endeavor
* will make your living room look like it belongs in a magazine
* can be used with GIANT knitting needles OR arms

* can be expensive (but only relatively so - ten pounds of roving can be considerably less expensive than ten pounds of spun yarn)
* limited availability (though this may change as GIANT knitting continues to grow)
* lower quality roving can be scratchy (stick with 19 & 23 micron roving to be safe!)
* requires dry cleaning as washing it with soap & water will **[felt][0]** the fiber
* finished products, especially blankets, can be quite heavy
* shedding & pilling\*
* warping - as with traditional knitting, the looser the stitches, the less stable the shape of the finished product - meaning your rectangle blanket may shapeshift into a rounded square over time
* occasionally roving will arrive with breaks that need to be tied or, better yet, felted together in order to continue knitting with one long strand (splits & tears can also occur after the roving has been knitted if, for instance, something gets caught in the stitches -**[needle felting][1]** is generally the best way to address all these issues)
* roving is a raw material that generally comes directly from a mill, so the fiber is sometimes not quite as clean as processed, spun yarn - often bits of hay, dirt, or other colored fibers will get mixed into the roving so you may need to spend some time picking out each individual bit of foreign material from your fiber before, during, and even after knitting with it (it may be worth spending a bit more if your supplier is willing to do this for you so all you need to concentrate on is your big, beautiful project!)

Have you noticed the wave of GIANT blankets washing over the internet this winter season? They're showing up all over magazines, blogs, and just might be flooding your Pinterest feed by now. What once was a little known, somewhat quirky technique used in fiber art installations, and later appeared on runways all over the world in outlandish shapes and textures, has become a home decor must-have and one of the most popular DIY knitting projects of the year.Whether you purchase a kit or a finished blanket, based on the most frequently asked questions we get about GIANT knit blankets, here are a few things you may want to consider before investing as much as $1000 in this heirloom beauty:What is Merino Wool Roving?

It might just be the hottest chunky yarn on the market this winter season and unless you've been around the fiber scene for a while you may never have even heard of it. When roving isn't being knitted into Giant Chunky Blankets it is a nearly raw material that is spun into the more familiar yarns that are used to knit socks, hats and sweaters on smaller sized needles.

**Should I Arm or Needle Knit?**

The decision to arm-knit or use a set of GIANT knitting needles really depends on personal preference, the type of stitch you're looking for and your budget. Arm stitches tend to be larger and looser than needle stitches and therefore use less roving per square foot than needle stitched blankets - so they cost less to make. However, the tighter your stitch the more substantial and durable your blanket will be so it might be worth the investment if you're looking for the greater value in a blanket that lasts for years and years. One advantage that you'll quickly appreciate when working with GIANT straight or circular needles is the ability to walk away from your WIP and the option to experiment with a variety of stitch patterns, making your chunky blanket truly one of a kind.

**What's the best way to care for my merino wool roving blanket?**

Merino wool roving is a raw, unspun fiber so professional dry-cleaning is the best way to care for your new favorite blanket!

**How durable is this blanket?**

Great question. This is something that we talk about a lot so keep in mind that this is a raw and unspun fiber so it doesn't behave like traditional yarns you'd find in the store. If you've got kids, pets or tend to spill things that stain, you might want to consider waiting before you add one of these beauties to your list of household treasures.

The two things that are most likely to happen with your blanket are called shedding and pilling. In the beginning your blanket will shed some of the looser and shorter fibers from the strand -- this is completely normal and will lessen over time. Pilling is what happens when little balls of fiber form as a result of friction across the surface of your blanket. This is nothing to worry about as they can be carefully removed with a small set of scissors to preserve the original beauty of the wool roving.

**What's the difference between natural and dyed wool roving?**

Beyond the color, few people will notice a significant difference between the wool roving that has been dyed or left natural. The dyeing process can sometimes result in a flatter strand as opposed to natural un-dyed strands that tend to be round, fluffy and EVEN SOFTER than when dyed a rich and vibrant color.

**Is Merino Wool Roving Itchy?**

The most widely used fiber in extreme knitting of chunky blankets is Merino wool roving in 19 or 23 microns. Both are soft, warm and rarely itchy, with 19 micron merino wool roving being the more luxurious of the two.

**Should I buy it or knit it myself?**

If you've ever knitted anything you can knit one of these blankets! Not only is it super cool to have the biggest needles on the block but can you imagine how satisfying it is to start AND FINISH a project in an afternoon?!

That being said, if you can live without the sense of satisfaction and just want the best blanket ever delivered to your door -- that's a great option too! In which case, just click here!
