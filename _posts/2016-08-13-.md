**_Nine things to consider before investing in that GIANT knit blanket..._**

Have you noticed the wave of GIANT blankets washing over the internet this winter season? They're showing up all over magazines, blogs, and just might be flooding your Pinterest feed by now. What once was a little known, somewhat quirky technique used in fiber art installations, and later appeared on runways all over the world in outlandish shapes and textures, has become a home decor must-have and one of the most popular DIY knitting projects of the year.Whether you purchase a kit or a finished blanket, based on the most frequently asked questions we get about GIANT knit blankets, here are a few things you may want to consider before investing as much as $1000 in this heirloom beauty:What is Merino Wool Roving? 

It might just be the hottest chunky yarn on the market this winter season and unless you've been around the fiber scene for a while you may never have even heard of it. When roving isn't being knitted into Giant Chunky Blankets it is a nearly raw material that is spun into the more familiar yarns that are used to knit socks, hats and sweaters on smaller sized needles.

**Should I Arm or Needle Knit? **

The decision to arm-knit or use a set of GIANT knitting needles really depends on personal preference, the type of stitch you're looking for and your budget. Arm stitches tend to be larger and looser than needle stitches and therefore use less roving per square foot than needle stitched blankets - so they cost less to make. However, the tighter your stitch the more substantial and durable your blanket will be so it might be worth the investment if you're looking for the greater value in a blanket that lasts for years and years. One advantage that you'll quickly appreciate when working with GIANT straight or circular needles is the ability to walk away from your WIP and the option to experiment with a variety of stitch patterns, making your chunky blanket truly one of a kind.

**What's the best way to care for my merino wool roving blanket?**

Merino wool roving is a raw, unspun fiber so professional dry-cleaning is the best way to care for your new favorite blanket!

**How durable is this blanket?**

Great question. This is something that we talk about a lot so keep in mind that this is a raw and unspun fiber so it doesn't behave like traditional yarns you'd find in the store. If you've got kids, pets or tend to spill things that stain, you might want to consider waiting before you add one of these beauties to your list of household treasures.

The two things that are most likely to happen with your blanket are called shedding and pilling. In the beginning your blanket will shed some of the looser and shorter fibers from the strand -- this is completely normal and will lessen over time. Pilling is what happens when little balls of fiber form as a result of friction across the surface of your blanket. This is nothing to worry about as they can be carefully removed with a small set of scissors to preserve the original beauty of the wool roving.

**What's the difference between natural and dyed wool roving?**

Beyond the color, few people will notice a significant difference between the wool roving that has been dyed or left natural. The dyeing process can sometimes result in a flatter strand as opposed to natural un-dyed strands that tend to be round, fluffy and EVEN SOFTER than when dyed a rich and vibrant color. 

**Is Merino Wool Roving Itchy?**

The most widely used fiber in extreme knitting of chunky blankets is Merino wool roving in 19 or 23 microns. Both are soft, warm and rarely itchy, with 19 micron merino wool roving being the more luxurious of the two.

**Should I buy it or knit it myself?**

If you've ever knitted anything you can knit one of these blankets! Not only is it super cool to have the biggest needles on the block but can you imagine how satisfying it is to start AND FINISH a project in an afternoon?! 

That being said, if you can live without the sense of satisfaction and just want the best blanket ever delivered to your door -- that's a great option too! In which case, just click here!

**How do I choose which needles to use?**

Just like their much smaller cousins, Giant needles come in a variety of lengths and sizes in both [straights][1] and [circulars][2]. Most of our clients are using size 120 and 150 needles to make their chunky blankets and remember, the smaller the needle, the more roving you'll need.
